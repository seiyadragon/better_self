                    `Many people believe success is just making a lot of money or rising to the top within their industry. 
                    And this to some degree, is success. You have achieved something that many people cannot even dream of accomplishing.
                    However when you look behind you, you see the path of destruction left behind by your neglect of other activities. 
                    You can see that this is the wrong approach and way of viewing it. Success is a mindset, nothing more, nothing less. 
                    And you can tell the truly successful people apart from the fakes, due to the simple fact that when you adopt the success mindset, 
                    it reflects in every aspect of your life. Attaining the success mindset is not an easy task however, one must be willing to 
                    sacrifice pleasures, all of them, every single thing you enjoy, you must throw it away. You must learn to control your mind, 
                    and your emotions like a Jedi. This is a concept that took time to understand, while the sith have more natural appeal, they are broken, 
                    miserable, and full of hate, they are addicts constantly seeking short term reward. 
                    You must be a Jedi and resist these temptations in life, and control your mind, and forces beyond our understanding will reward you.`
